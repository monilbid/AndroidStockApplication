# AndroidStockApplication

This is an Android application that a user can use to search for different companies that are on the Stock Market and view their stock prices.
The user can type either the stock symbol or the company name and it will display the list of companies related to that query.
Once the list of results loads you can tap on the company that you want and it will add that company to your saved stocks which will be stored on the device.
If you choose not to have any of the companies in your saved companies list you can tap on the company and select on Delete at the bottom of the screen.
This app can display the content in two panes if the user is using a large device, like a tablet, or in landscape mode.
This app also supports French as one of the additional languages.
